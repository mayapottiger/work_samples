## Public Housing Evictions

I was the lead data analyst on the [Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/about-merrill/signature-programs/the-howard-center-for-investigative-journalism/) fall 2020 project looking into evictions by public housing authorities across the country. For the project, we highlighted six counties across the country where public housing authorities were among the highest eviction filers in the county.

For this project,

## DC 311 Analysis

My first project with the Howard Center, I was the data analyst for Washington, D.C. Using Open Data D.C., I pulled down 311 data going back to 2010 to analyze homeless-related calls. What I first noticed was that the specific service code for homeless calls had been eliminated in June 2015. After that, I had to use a string of search terms in the "details" section of each call to try to identify which ones were related to homeless encampments or individuals.

I also geocoded the latitude and longitude of the calls to be able to use the census data to get demographics about where the calls were coming from. Through that, I found the calls mostly came from areas with higher median incomes.
